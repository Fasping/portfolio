            I am <span className="purple">Fernando </span>
            originally from sunny
            <span className="purple"> Barcelona, Spain </span>
            since 2019 happily making a new home at

            When I'm not busy scribbling code, I like to keep things interesting
            by climbing mountains, gaming like there's no tomorrow, and scouring
            the earth for rare vinyls...You could say I'm a collector, but
            instead of stamps or coins, I collect grooves and scratches.

            My
            <span className="purple"> educational</span> background is rooted in
            <span className="purple"> psychology</span> at UAB in Barcelona. But
            I found myself drawn to technology and coding. So, I decided to
            embark on the ultimate coding journey and attended the IronHack Full
            Stack Web Development <span className="purple"> Bootcamp</span>.
            After graduate, I have gained
            <span className="purple"> one and a half years </span>
            of experience working in a company in Stockholm, Sweden as a
            Frontend Developer. When I'm not typing away at my computer, you can
            find me flexing my unit testing muscles with Jest and Vitest, and
            slowly but surely, I'm becoming a TypeScript lover! (Well, I'm
            getting slowely there...) You can find more of my work on my GitHub
            profile.
